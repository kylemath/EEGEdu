# EEGEdu

I want this to be a educational tool
To teach
So in picturing an interactive web page that you scroll or pass through each of these demos
Like EEG 101 but on the web
And with chances for them to do the coding
With p5js for example
So it's a 10 parts lesson or something
1. Connect + hardware
2. Biophysics + signal viewing
3. Simple evoked example
4. Frequency domain explanation
5. Raw spectra
6. Frequency bands
7. Spectrogram
8. Record data
9. BCI trainer




As a starting point this is Forked from tanvanch/muse-fft
muse-fft: Explore Muse headband data in frequency domain. Written with Muse.js, EEG-Pipes, React and Charts.js.
