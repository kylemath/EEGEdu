  	"In the next demo we will look at the frequency domain signal divided into bands. ", 
  	"However this time we will divide the spectra into the traditional frequency bands. ", 
  	"We want to identify the magnitude of oscillations of different frequencies in our live signal. ",
  	"We use the fast fourier transform to convert the voltage values over time to the power at each frequency. ",
  	"To use the fft we pick a particular chunk of data and get an output called a spectra. ",
  	"Each time the chart updates a new window of data is selected."
