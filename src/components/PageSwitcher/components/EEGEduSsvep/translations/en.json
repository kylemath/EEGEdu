    "In the next demo we run our second experiment, comparing the spectra in another two conditions. ",
    "When we see or hear rhythms in our environemnts (music, flashing lights, etc.), our brain picks up on those rhythms. ",
    "The brain starts to pick up on the rhythms and begins to oscillate at the same frequency. ", 
    "This is called a steady-state response, or sometimes entrainement, and depends on cognitive factors like attention as well. ",
    "Here we will compare the spectra in two conditions of different rhythmic visual stimulation.",
    "WARNING: The following experiment utilizes flashing stimuli"
