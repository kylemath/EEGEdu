    "Back to the full spectra, we can also look at how this changes over time in a single image. ",
    "This image, with time on the horizontal x-axis and freqency on the vertical y-axis is like a heat map or topographic map. ",
    "Darker regions represent frequencies and times with larger power. ",
    "Remember that on the spectra power is the vertical dimension, here is the is the colour."
