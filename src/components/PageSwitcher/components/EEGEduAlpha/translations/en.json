    "In the next demo we run our first experiment, comparing the spectra when eyes are open vs when they are closed. ",
    "In this module you will first adjust the muse so the signal is good, and then record two sessions of data. ",
    "In one, you will keep you eyes open and stare at a single point on the screen that pops up. ", 
    "In the other, you will close your eyes and the recording will begin. ",
    "Alpha oscillations are found to be larger when the eyes are closed than when they are open."
